       notes on Variables
        - a variable must begin with a letter , underscore , or dollar sign 
        - numbers may follow the above characters, but cannot come first
        - javascript is case sensitive - hello and Hello are different variables 
        - no spaces are allowed in variable names 
        - camelCase is the best practice for naming variables 
                 camelCase, snake_case, pascalCase
